# dike_conductiveheating_1d
Conductive heating/melting model used in Biasi and Karlstrom (2021) MagnetoGeothermometry paper

Instructions: To conduct parameter sweeps of Currie temperature resetting as in figures S29 and S30, please run wrapper_dikeCurriePt_plots.m

diffusion_1d_dikewrapper.m could be used for single runs of the diffusion model

diffusion_1d_dike.m is the primary solver

meltfraction.m contains material models parameterized as melt fraction/temperature curves
